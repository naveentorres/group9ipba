			<h2 style="font-size:35px; color: black; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">Gender issue during the Historical Period: Gender Inequality</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20px">In the 19th century, women suffered from gender inequality. They were considered second-class citizens regardless of their ethnicity. In this century they were not allowed to vote, sue, testify in court, hardly granted custody of their children and were barred from institutions of higher education. According to an article called Feminism in literature, women were expected to remain subservient to their fathers and husbands. The only occupations they were allowed to take part in were as domestic servants, or laborer in factories or mills.
			<h2 style="font-size: 35px; color: Black; text-align: left;">List of identified solutions:</h2>
			<ol style="text-align:left; font-size: 20px">
				<li>(Gender equality) help gender equality share household chores equally pay the same salary for equal work, Share social posts that uplift women, Start a conversation about basic terms and more</li>
				<li>To help gender equality it is needed to give proper value to women’s work and raise aspirations of women
				<li>Make education gender sensitive</li>
				<li>Give proper value to 'women's work'</li>s
				<li>Spread more information about women’s right</li>
				<li>Women empowerment</li>	
			</ol>
			<h2 style="font-size: 35px; color: black; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10;">List of Brainstorming technique used:</h2>
			<ol style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
				<li>Mind map</li>
				<li>Starbursting</li>
				<li>5 Why's</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 style="text-align:left; font-size: 35px; color:black;">Final Solution: Gender Equality</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;font-size: 20px">Gender equality is when people of all genders have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities Gender equality in the workforce means being paid the same salary for equal work, regardless of gender.Gender equality is a human right good for the economy and  prevents violence against women and girls.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify; color: black; font-size: 20px;">Why didn't we choose "Give proper value to women’s work and raise aspirations of women",  yes the problem is about women's history and them being treated unfairly but giving more value and help women gain more power will also be unfair to the opposite gender (men & boys) that's why "gender equality" is more useful since we get to treat both genders fairly and equally.</p> 
			<p style="text-align: justify; color: black; font-size: 20px;">How about "Spread more information about women’s right" even tho women need more support and to raise more awareness about them being treated unfairly because of population thinking they're weak, the solution spread more information about women's right is already part of the gender equality
